WordPress headline testing with Optimizely

== Description ==

HeadlineEnvy adds the ability to A/B test the titles of your content
through integration with Optimizely.

__Features include:__

* __Unrestricted headline variations.__ When creating the test for a headline, you can add as many or as few as you wish.
* __Test headlines anywhere.__ Headline variations are applied to any place that your titles are output regardless of whether they appear on a post page, in the navigation, etc.
* __Experiment results.__ Revisit posts in the dashboard to check the status of headline statistical significance while your headline experiments are executed.
* __Automatic headline selection.__ Optionally choose to let HeadlineEnvy and Optimizely detect statistically significant winners and automatically update the post with the winning title.
